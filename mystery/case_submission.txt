These are the clues:

The suspect is around 6' tall.

The killer has a membership to AAA, Delta Skymiles, the library, and the Bash History Museum.

When questioned, the barista at a local coffee shop said that a latte the suspect ordered had the name Annabel on it, 
and that they had blonde spiky hair, and a New Zealand accent.

There seems to be two key suspects:
 Oluswasegun Annabel;
 and Annabel Fuglsang.

Seems as though neither of the suspects were up to trouble... or so we think.

However, we did get some information as to a blue honda with a license plate the starts with L337 and ends with 9.

There are three new suspects on the list:
Jeremy Bowers;
Heather Billings;
and Erika Owens.

It seems that Jeremy Bowers is the most likely suspect.
He has just left on a trip, fits the height description, and drives a Blue Honda.

Jeremy also owns a membership to all places found on the cards within the forgotten wallet.
